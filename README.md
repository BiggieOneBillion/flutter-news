# news_app

A Flutter project, a news app that also has the feature of saving news article you that you want to read later or for future reference.

Flutter was used to build the cross platform mobile application and I used an external news api to fetch the news article using the http package.

And also I built a Restful Api Node.js backend connected to a Mongodb Database, for storing and retrieving the data.
